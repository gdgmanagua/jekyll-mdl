Continuing with our celebration on [TensorFlow Dev Summit 2020](https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit), we are pleased to announce a fun competition - **TweetsOnTF**!

Now, before you jump to conclusions, please take the time out to read the following pointers and rules to participate in the competition:

- The competition is open to everyone!

- You need to pick a machine learning concept (not necessarily specific to TensorFlow) that starts with a letter from this letter set -  **TENSORFLOW** and explain it briefly in the form of Twitter threads.

- One tweet should focus on only one concept not multiple. *A tweet can have a maximum of three threads*.

- You can choose a *maximum of three different unique letters* from **TENSORFLOW** and create a *maximum of three separate tweets* on each of the concepts starting with those unique letters.

- At least one of the threads in a particular Tweet needs to mention **@TFUGKol** and **#TweetsOnTF**. You cannot change any casing in either of the two and if you do so your entry will be disqualified.

- You can use figures in their threads but the figures cannot contain anything explanatory text.

- After each of the Tweets, you will have to submit [this form](https://forms.gle/8wNLae5mduPF3CYM6).

_**If you fail to adhere to any of the rules mentioned above, your entry will get disqualified**_.
