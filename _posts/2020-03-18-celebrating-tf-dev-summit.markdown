**COVID-19** hit the world pretty hard causing stern losses. It included turning many in-person flagship developer conferences to completely online. TensorFlow’s annual developer conference [<span class="underline">TensorFlow Dev Summit</span>](https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit) was no exception. This year it was a livestream only event and it took place on March 11.

The TensorFlow ecosystem is pretty huge and it’s growing. Here are some of the key components of that:

Like every year, the TensorFlow team introduced a number of new initiatives, [<span class="underline">TensorFlow Quantum</span>](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/) being the most recent one. As a [<span class="underline">TensorFlow User Group</span>](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/groups), we decided to run a short Twitter threads’ series to express our favorite recipes and updates from the summit. Spoiler alert: The topics include [<span class="underline">TensorFlow Hub</span>](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub), [<span class="underline">TensorFlow Lite</span>](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite), [<span class="underline">TensorFlow JS</span>](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), TensorFlow for NLP, [<span class="underline">TensorFlow Quantum</span>](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum) (obvious, eh?), and TensorFlow Profiler. To know more about those updates briefly, just keep on reading.

# TensorFlow certification, revamped MLCC, more

This time there was something for all. The tensorFlow team introduced some really exciting news and opportunities. They are listed as follows:

1. [TensorFlow Certification](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate): Do you want to differentiate yourself and demonstrate your skills to a wider audience. You can be recognized with the newly announced TensorFlow certification program. This is intended as a foundational certificate for students, developers, and data scientists. The evaluation will be done on the basis of an exam which will cost $100. Once you have cleared this exam you can be part of their certificate network.

Just so that people from every walk of lives can benefit from this program, they also have a [TensorFlow education stipend](https://www.tensorflow.org/site-assets/downloads/marketing/cert/TF_Education_Stipend.pdf).

2. TensorFlow Hub: If you are not into building custom models from scratch TensorFlow got you covered. TensorFlow Hub hosts a comprehensive collection of over 1000 pre-trained models with documentation, code snippets, and demos ready to be used. You can find them [<span class="underline">here</span>](https://tfhub.dev/).

As an enthusiastic DL practitioner, you would also want to publish your model vai TensorFlow Hub. It would really add so much value to your profile and resume. To learn more about this visit [<span class="underline">here</span>](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/tree/master/tfhub_dev).

3. Revamped [<span class="underline">MLCC</span>](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course): Google Machine Learning Crash Course is one of the finest crash courses on ML/DL out there. And they have just updated it to use TensorFlow 2.x and even better, students will now build models using tf.keras. The new exercises there will now have clearer instructions. If you are a beginner, it’s the best time to start your ML journey.

# Conclusion

\#TFDevSummit 2020 had Machine Learning recipes for everyone - be it a developer, a pro researcher or someone who is getting started with machine learning. They have increased support with tools and technologies in every domain. We at TensorFlow User Group Kolkata can't wait to explore them all. Meanwhile, as an ML enthusiast, you must have heard of Kaggle and some of you might be a pro in that sphere. But practically there is a huge difference in what Machine Learning is on Kaggle and off Kaggle, to give you more insights on this we have **Aakash Nain**, Research Engineer at Ola and also a GDE in ML joining us this Sunday. Don't worry we are going online hence be safe and learn from home. To grab this opportunity, register here: [<span class="underline">http://bit.ly/TFDSKol20Online</span>](http://bit.ly/TFDSKol20Online). Feel free to share this link in your own network.

Until the next TFDevSummit let's keep the learning curve going.
