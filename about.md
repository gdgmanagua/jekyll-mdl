TensorFlow User Group (TFUG) Kolkata is a local community for developers, researchers, users, and writers interested in ML. TFUG Kolkata's meetups are composed of events around ML and TF to share best practices, discuss the future technology road-map, upcoming features, technology pitfalls and the entire gamut of Google’s TF related panoramic technology landscape.

Join our public Telegram group here: https://t.me/TFUGKol (https://t.me/TFUGKol?fbclid=IwAR09tthKfL-JkYEYZiV4zde0To1hQJPR0SihYGLEgbbA9wGUV8fMVUxxElo). This group will focus on general discussions around Machine Learning and TensorFlow. You are encouraged to join it. When you do so, don't forget to introduce yourself.

We have a forever open CFP: https://forms.gle/qrxZRARhjNx5e4e46. 

If you have a cool ML project to showcase or if you want to present on an ML topic at any of our events/meetups, then this CFP is for you. We will contact you if your session is deemed to be a fit.
